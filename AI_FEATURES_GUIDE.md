## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "AI Features Available!" message showing?

**Problem**: Ollama not installed or not running

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# If not running, start it
ollama serve

# Check if models are installed
ollama list

# If no models, pull one
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

### "Error generating AI insights"?

**Common fixes**:
1. Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
2. Check you have a model downloaded: `ollama list`
3. Try pulling a smaller model: `ollama pull llama3.2:1b`
4. Check your Mac has enough RAM (8GB+ recommended)

### Generation takes too long?

**Solutions**:
1. Use a smaller model: `llama3.2:1b` or `phi3:mini`
2. Close other apps to free up RAM
3. First generation is slower (model loading), subsequent ones are faster

### "Model not found" error?

**Solution**:
```bash
# List what you have
ollama list

# Pull the model you selected
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```
